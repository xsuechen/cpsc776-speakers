                <p>We're very glad to be having our next Guest Speaker, Eric Ma, join us for this session. In his own words: "I am a Principal Data Scientist at Moderna Therapeutics and alumni of Novartis, Insight Data Science, MIT, and UBC. I aim to make science run at the speed of scientists' creative thought. My teammates and I use probabilistic models, deep neural networks, network science, and large language models as tools in our toolkit to make this happen."</p>
